This will be a living document for the design and development of the SmartCal project. All updates to the document will be tracked in the [changelog](#changlog)

## Objective

Build a smart calendar that can be hung on the wall of our kitchen.
The calendar will help our family keep track of our daily scheduled
by integrating with out google calendars.

In addition to calendar support that smart calendar should also support an array of widgets
that can be displayed along side the calendar. This will be used to share /
keep track of relavent information to the whole family. The first widget will be an integration with
Google Keep to display pinned notes. This is mainly to support a shared grocery list, to-do list, and
a weekly meal plan.
